🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project involves building a simple machine learning model to classify the species of Iris flowers using the popular Iris dataset. The classification is based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
📌 Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic example of a multi-class classification problem, and it is often used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning and data science.
🔍 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 150 rows and 5 columns:
    Sepal Length (in cm)
    Sepal Width (in cm)
    Petal Length (in cm)
    Petal Width (in cm)
    Species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)
Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
